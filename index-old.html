		<h3> Buckle up B<font color="ff017d">*</font>tches!</h3>
		<div id="type">
		<h4>WOW! Hi! I can’t freaking believe how deeply and passionately I have fallen in love with my awesome <font color="ff017d">((305))</font> managers and co workers in the past three months. NEVER IN MY LIFE have I been excited to wake up at 5 am to mop sweat off the floor and yet here we are.<br><br>
For anyone who has ever been in love, you know how hard it is to describe the connection you have with this significant “other” but read on and watch me try. Our brand at <font color="ff017d">((305))</font> is so importantly unapologetic. We beat our chests as heated feminists, equal rights activists and air humping independent divas. I identify with every single ounce of that. It is my dream to encourage fellow junkies in any way that I can. <font color="ff017d">((305))</font> is for me at its very least, my home. Nowhere else am I encouraged so fiercely to be myself and love on others.<br><br>
Now, as in most relationships, we are at a crossroads. There are a few opportunities at <font color="ff017d">((305))</font> that I am more than interested in. First and foremost, that bangin’ management position with that B-E-A-utiful new studio in DC. The following are my top 5 most relevant qualifications in a GIF list for your enjoyment.</h4>
